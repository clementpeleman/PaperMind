# PaperMind Agentic Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines the planned phases for making PaperMind more agentic using LangChain and AI agents.

## Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] **Infrastructure: Install LangChain dependencies** - @langchain/openai, @langchain/core, langchain
- [ ] **Infrastructure: Set up agent configuration and environment variables** - OpenAI API keys, vector DB config
- [ ] **Infrastructure: Create agent base classes and interfaces** - Base agent architecture
- [ ] **Infrastructure: Add agent API endpoints and integration points** - REST endpoints for agent interactions

## Phase 1: Basic Agents

### 1.1 Paper Analysis Agent
- [ ] **Create Paper Analysis Agent with LangChain**
  - Analyze key findings, methodology, limitations
  - Extract future work suggestions and relevant citations
  - Identify research gaps in individual papers
  - Use structured output schemas with Zod

### 1.2 Research Gap Agent  
- [ ] **Implement Research Gap Agent**
  - Identify research gaps across paper collections
  - Analyze opportunities for new research
  - Provide trend analysis of research domains
  - Generate specific research recommendations

### 1.3 Smart Column Agent
- [ ] **Upgrade AI column generation to use Smart Column Agent**
  - Specialized sub-agents for different analysis types (methodology, limitations, future work)
  - Intelligent column type suggestions based on paper collection
  - Context-aware content generation

### 1.4 Structured Outputs
- [ ] **Add structured output schemas with Zod**
  - Consistent response formats across all agents
  - Type-safe agent interactions
  - Improved error handling and validation

## Phase 2: RAG Integration

### 2.1 Vector Database Setup
- [ ] **Set up vector database integration**
  - Choose between Pinecone or Supabase Vector
  - Create paper embeddings pipeline
  - Index management and updates

### 2.2 Literature Review Agent
- [ ] **Implement Literature Review Agent with RAG**
  - Semantic search and retrieval across papers
  - Generate comprehensive literature reviews
  - Context-aware paper recommendations
  - Question-answering over paper collections

### 2.3 Paper Similarity
- [ ] **Create paper similarity matching**
  - Related paper suggestions
  - Thematic clustering of research
  - Duplicate detection and consolidation

### 2.4 Semantic Search
- [ ] **Add semantic search functionality**
  - Natural language queries over paper collection
  - Advanced filtering and ranking
  - Query expansion and refinement

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent System

### 3.1 Research Assistant Chat
- [ ] **Build Research Assistant Chat component**
  - Multi-agent orchestration
  - Natural language interface for research tasks
  - Real-time paper analysis and insights

### 3.2 Agent Tools
- [ ] **Create agent tools**
  - Search papers by content/metadata
  - Compare multiple papers
  - Generate research questions
  - Extract and synthesize information

### 3.3 Memory and Persistence
- [ ] **Implement agent memory**
  - Conversation history persistence
  - User preference learning
  - Context retention across sessions

### 3.4 Function Calling
- [ ] **Add agent executor with function calling**
  - Dynamic tool selection
  - Multi-step reasoning workflows
  - Error handling and recovery

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 Automated Workflows
- [ ] **Create automated research workflow system**
  - Paper ingestion to analysis pipeline
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Scheduled analysis updates

### 4.2 Citation Network Analysis
- [ ] **Implement citation network analysis agent**
  - Paper relationship mapping
  - Influence and impact analysis
  - Research lineage tracking

### 4.3 Trend Prediction
- [ ] **Build research trend prediction**
  - Emerging topic identification
  - Future research direction forecasting
  - Hot topic alerts and notifications

### 4.4 Collaborative Recommendations
- [ ] **Add collaborative research recommendations**
  - User interest-based suggestions
  - Research community connections
  - Collaborative filtering for papers

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Increased time spent analyzing papers
- **Research Efficiency**: Faster literature reviews and gap identification  
- **Discovery**: More relevant paper recommendations and insights
- **Automation**: Reduced manual effort in research workflows

## Technical Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design for growing paper collections
- **Performance**: Optimize vector search and LLM calls
- **Cost Management**: Token usage optimization
- **Privacy**: Secure handling of research data
- **Integration**: Seamless UX with existing PaperMind features

## Getting Started

1. Begin with Infrastructure setup
2. Start Phase 1 with Paper Analysis Agent
3. Gather user feedback early and often
4. Iterate based on real research use cases
